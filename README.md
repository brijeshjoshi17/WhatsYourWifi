# WhatsYourWifi
Simple app to allow users to share their wifi information with others.

## TODO
- Identify kind of network ie open, WPA, WEP etc.
- Allow user to select the network they want to be able to share and input the passphrase to store in the app. The passphrase will probably need to be stored in encrypted form.
- Flesh out process for using Wifi Direct to transmit to a secondary device

### Further nice-to-haves
- Make UX better
- Push notification to sender device to open app and begin transfer process
